Purposes:
Compute orbital angular momentum matrix L and analyse g factors based on JDFTx code


Lmatrix_gfactor_from_pmatrix.py:
The script computing L and g factor.
The script needs to specify some input paramters inside.
See more details inside the script.


example.tar.gz:
It contains an MoS2 example of using Lmatrix_gfactor_from_pmatrix.py
It contains a README file for itself


L_VS_bands.png:
Calculated expectation values of L (diagonal elements of matrix L) along z axis of 4 bands as a function of number of bands.
The results agree with Fig. 4 of Phys. Rev. B 101, 235408 (2020)
